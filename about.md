I am a data scientist and researcher with diverse technical, analytical and communication skills and a passion for problem-solving. I have a background in biological and medical research and am interested in the development and application of novel data analysis and machine learning techniques in these fields and beyond.

To pursue these interests further I am currently completing an intensive Data Science course at General Assembly, developing my skills in data analytics, modelling and machine learning. Prior to this I have completed a PhD in molecular virology at the University of Sydney, as well as conducting laboratory-based research in microbiology at both the University of Sydney and UTS. Between my current learning and past research, I have been collecting, analysing and communicating with data for over a decade.

So far in 2018 I’ve combined my learning at General Assembly with self-directed learning to build skills in python, SQL, Tableau, data analysis, data visualisation, web scraping, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, neural networks and computer vision.

I am a firm believer in the idea that the better we understand the world, the better we will be able to find solutions to help us navigate the challenges we face. That’s why I am interested in pursuing a career where I can apply innovative techniques and technology to help understand the rapidly growing flood of data we collect every day.
